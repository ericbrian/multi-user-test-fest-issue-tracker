# Test Fest Issue Tracker - Room Setup Guide

## How to Create a Test Fest (Room)

When you click "Create New Test Fest", you'll be prompted to:

1. **Test Fest Name**: Give your test fest a descriptive name

   - Examples: "Mobile App Testing", "Website Redesign", "Payment System Testing"
   - This name will also be used as the test script name

2. **Description** (Optional): Provide additional details about what you're testing
   - Example: "Testing the new mobile app features including login, navigation, and core functionality"

## How Issues Work

- When creating a test fest, the test fest room and the test fest script are created at the same time and a script ID is created automatically.
- When creating an issue, you must enter the ID of the item under test. This is taken from the actual test script.
- If you reference a Script ID that doesn't exist as a formal test script, the issue will still be created
