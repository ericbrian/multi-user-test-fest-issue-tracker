# Test Fest Issue Tracker - Room Setup Guide

## How to Create a Test Fest (Room)

When you click "Create New Test Fest", you'll be prompted to:

1. **Test Fest Name**: Give your test fest a descriptive name

   - Examples: "Mobile App Testing", "Website Redesign", "Payment System Testing"
   - This name will also be used as the test script name

2. **Description** (Optional): Provide additional details about what you're testing
   - Example: "Testing the new mobile app features including login, navigation, and core functionality"

## How Issues Work

- Each Test Fest has exactly one test script with the same name as the room
- The test script automatically gets ID = 1
- When creating an issue, you simply describe the problem - no need to select a script
- All issues in a room are automatically associated with that room's test script
